-Create a CSV file with columns 

# Steps to follow
1. Acquire a API key.
2. Install all the pre-requisites. 
3. Save the code to a Python file or a Jupyter Notebook.
4. "YOUR OWN-API-KEY" in the code should be changed to reflect your actual API key.
5 .Execute by launching the Python file or running it in a Jupyter Notebook.
