Ignatius J. Reilly,"Hi, thank you very much for this high quality course, a real master piece. Maybe as a newbie, I could be wrong but it seems there is an error in the explaination of the data preprocessing (usage of standardscaler). The standard scaler has to be fit and transform the train sample however, the scaler parameters should then be stored and it has to ONLY transform the next sample (valid and test). Fitting the scaler on the valid and test sample could have a bad effect the the X values and misaligned the data from the train sample. Once again, I'm new on this topic but it seems quite clear this standard scaler usage is inappropriate.",2023-05-11T19:44:28Z,0,0

Regulus Sirius,"Went this course  I would rate  at 3 or 3.5 out of 5.
What could have been better ...

An in-depth mathematical  analysis  on the  ML algorithms should be explained as it is very much essential  to  understand  the inner working  of algorithms.

Use of scikit learn  package should have been done in more detailed  way like explaining  the  hyper parameters  and how to tune them to increase  accuracy.

And an Exploratory Data Analysis  should be done and explained
 
And use more of visualization  using matplotlib  for KNN,navie Bayes and SVM for the given data (not from the presentation  point of view )

Use of new data sets like this is a positive point .
Would like to see more of ML on scientific  data sets like Geospatial  data , astronomical  data . 

The course is like an overview  or quick glance of ML algorithms",2022-10-24T15:54:52Z,1,1

Tom Kingston,In general software engineers usually don’t do anything with machine learning. Machine learning leans very heavily into data science. There are sub groups of software engineers such as machine learning engineers who write libraries which data scientists use. But to get in that field requires a lot of study and schooling. Not only do you have to know how to write software but also have to have a solid foundation in data science.,2022-10-27T07:48:57Z,2,

Jesus Christ Saves,"THE GOSPEL

Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also 
ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
- 1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 KJV

Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. - John 15:13 KJV

SAVALATION 

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
- John 3:16 KJV

For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. John 3:17

Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
- John 14:6 KJV

Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. Acts 4:12

For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. Romans 5:10

But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. - Isaiah 53:5 

For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9 

And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.
- Mark 1:15 KJV


He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
- John 3:36 KJV

Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. 2 Timothy 1:9 

For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. Luke 19:10 

The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9

He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. Mark 16:16

For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. 1 Corinthians 15:22 

For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:7-8

I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. John 10:9

That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
- Romans 10:9-11 KJV

For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
- Romans 10:13 KJV

For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. Romans 1:16",2022-09-26T16:31:45Z,0,1
